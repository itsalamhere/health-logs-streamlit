## SportsLogs: Sport Loggings Dashboard

SportsLogs is a dashboard visualizing the performance of 16 players through 15 datasets: from distance and calories, up to sleep stages and wellness score. 
The data is taken from [PMData](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vlbthambawita/pmdata-a-sports-logging-dataset) where all data are collected from sources of 
biometric sensors (**FitBit**), sports logging (**PMSys**), and subjective scores on all players (**Google Docs**).

All data has been cleaned and then visualized through Jupyter Notebook and then transferred to Streamlit as a web-app dashboard.
