## SportsLogs: Sports Logging Web App Dashboard

SportsLogs is a web app dashboard visualizing the sport performance of 16 players through 10+ different datasets: from distance and calories, up to sleep stages and wellness score. 
The data is taken from [PMData](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vlbthambawita/pmdata-a-sports-logging-dataset) where all data are collected from sources of 
biometric sensors (**FitBit**), sports logging (**PMSys**), and subjective scores on all players (**Google Docs**). 
All data has been cleaned, visualized through Jupyter Notebook as a group of functions, and then transferred to Streamlit as a web-app dashboard.
