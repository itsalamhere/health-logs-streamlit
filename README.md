## SportsLogs: Sport Logging Dashboard

SportsLogs is a dashboard visualizing a sport performance of 16 players through 15 different datasets: from distance and calories, up to sleep stages and wellness score. 
The data is taken from [PMData](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vlbthambawita/pmdata-a-sports-logging-dataset) where all data are collected from sources of 
biometric sensors (**FitBit**), sports logging (**PMSys**), and subjective scores on all players (**Google Docs**). 
All data has been cleaned, visualized through Jupyter Notebook as a group of functions, and then transferred to Streamlit as a web-app dashboard.

Some notes:
- Several data are not used such as pXX/fitbit/injury.json and pXX/food-images. In addition, there are a number of player with missing values.
- Heart Rate Real-Time (the last 2 pictures) is created at first, but then retracted from the code due to limited space for the web-app.
